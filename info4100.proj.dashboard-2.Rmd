This project is about developing a learning analytics dashboard based on clicker data. You will work as a team to learn how to make a dashboard using R Shiny (official page with several tutorials: <https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/>).

**Learning Objectives**

1.  Understand the structure of clicker data
2.  Create multiple different visualizations
3.  Design and implement an instructor and student dashboard
4.  Critically evaluate your own dashboard design

You are given aggregated clicker records for a CS course taught at Cornell. There are two datasets: the experience dataset and the quiz dataset.

**Scenario**

You are approached by a college instructor who uses iClickers in her CS class on Business Intelligence. She would like to gain insights about her students and how they are engaging/performing in order to better help them in class. She would also like to better support students by giving them feedback at scale about where they stand and perhaps how they compare to others in the class.

You offer to build a prototype of a dashboard using her clicker data: this is a dashboard for the instructor which offers an overview of the class characteristics, engagement, and performance; and it is a dashboard for students which offers a specific student an overview of their engagement and performance (and how it compares to others).

**Data**

The **experience dataset** contains one record per student who completed the CS course between 2016-2018. There are two sources to this dataset: Faculty Center and a Skills Survey (administered via the Blackboard LMS) where students self reported their skill level for various skills the first week of class. This data has been de-identified. Name, netid, emplid, major have all been removed and replaced with a unique numeric identifier. Note that not all students completed the skills survey, they will have null values for the survey result fields.

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Definition |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| student_key | numeric Unique key | Assigned as part of de-identification process. Uniquely identifies student records for this data set only. |
| year | numeric | Four digit year student was enrolled in BI Class. |
| prog | character Values (GRAD, UGRAD) | Indicates whether the student was a graduate or undergraduate student when they were enrolled in BI course. |
| database_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with database technology prior to taking course. 0= no experience, 5= expertise |
| sql_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with SQL prior to taking course. 0= no experience, 5=expertise |
| programing_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with Any Programing language prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| stored_proc_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with stored procedure languages prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| etl_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with Extract Transform Load (ETL) development prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| data_vis_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level using data visualization tools prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| requirement_gather_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level gathering customer requirements prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| skill_survey_score | numeric | Sum of the self reported skill level scores. |

The **quiz dataset** contains one record per student per class session held where iClickers were used. Sources used in the creation of this data set include: iClicker session xml files, Blackboard gradebook (for quiz scores), and the Blackboard class schedule (used to map iClicker session to related quiz scores). Note that in some cases there are multiple iClicker sessions / lectures associated with a single quiz. This dataset may be joined to the experience dataset by the student_key field.

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Definition |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Acad_date_key | numeric | Date key in the form of YYYYMMDD indicating the date the class session was held. |
| student_key | numeric | Unique identifier for students who took BI class 2016-2018. This key is the primary key for the experience_data file. |
| year | numeric | Four digit year class session was held. |
| session_number | numeric | Identifies the session number for a particular semester. Session number is assigned by iClicker. |
| quiz_number | numeric | There are 10 quizzes throughout the BI course. This attribute indicates which quiz is associated with the iClicker session(s). |
| attended | numeric (0,1) | Binary indicating whether the student attended that particular class session / lecture. 0=no, 1=yes. |
| total_possible_clicker | numeric | The total number of iClicker questions asked that session. |
| total_completed_clicker | numeric | The number of iClicker questions answered by student that session. |
| completed_q_clicker | numeric | The number of completed Quiz iClicker questions |
| correct_q_clicker | numeric | How many correct Quiz answers by student that session. |
| completed_t_clicker | number | How many Temperature questions answered by student that session. Temperature questions are 0-5, 0= bad, 5=great. There is no correct answer to Temperature questions, they are used to guage how students are feeling about a particular subject, assignment, etc. |
| avg_t_clicker | number | The average temperature answer by student for that session. An average of 1 or 2 would be generally negative, while 4 or 5 would be generally positive responses. |
| quiz_score | numeric | Quiz score out of 20 points possible. |

# Part 1: Planning / Sketching

Go through the planning / sketching process described in the reading about dashboards. While some dashboards are certainly better than others, there is not one correct solution here. However, spending enough time to make a concrete plan is essential for the success of your project. Everything you do to make the dashboards will be easier if you have a clear plan, especially because you will be splitting up the work and everyone needs to know what they should work on.

**Question 1:** You will make a student dashboard and a teacher dashboard. Carefully consider the implications of this for design and content. To plan, answer the following prompts once for the student dashboard and then for the teacher dashboard. The more concrete you are here the easier it will be later. Focus on the concrete ideas that you will implement in the next steps. You can iterate on this step and modify your responses as your ideas for the dashboard become clearer. You should explore the dataset in R for 5-10 minutes to get a good sense of what the dataset has to offer.

*Planning for the student dashboard*

-   For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?
    -   [Individual students enrolled in the CS course on Business Intelligence.]
    -   [Likely undergraduates and graduates with varied technical backgrounds; some familiarity with data, but not necessarily advanced data analysis skills. They are the data subjects, so the dashboard should feel intuitive and personalized.]
-   Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?
    -   [Help students monitor and reflect on their performance and engagement in the course.]
    -   [Key Questions to Answer:
        -   How often have I attended class and answered clicker questions?
        -   How well have I done on the quizzes compared to the class average?
        -   Am I improving over time?
        -   How do I feel about topics (via temperature questions)，and how does that correlate with my performance?]
-   What? What data to show and what is its structure?
    -   [Data to Show:
    -   My Average Score: overall performance
    -   My Attendance: overall engagement
    -   General Performance: Scores per quiz with comparison to class average.
    -   Clicker Performance: Number of questions answered correctly/incorrectly, temperature, and unanswered per session over time
    -   Temperature Responses: Average temperature answer, categorized by positive (4-5), neutral (3), and negative (1-2), based on session(s)
    -   Monthly Attendance: Number of sessions attended/not attended, by month]
    -   [Structure: All data is student-specific and filtered by student_key.]
-   How? How will visualizations support the goal?
    -   Line graph for quiz scores over time with class average line.
    -   Stacked Bar chart for historic clicker performance (bar for \# correct, bar for \# incorrect, bar for temperature, bar for unanswered)
    -   Sentiment pie chart for how students felt across the course overall (3 pies: positive (4-5), neutral (3), and negative (1-2)), based on session(s)
    -   Stacked Area chart for distinguishing sessions attended vs not attended by month

*Planning for the teacher dashboard*

-   For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?
    -   [Audience: Course instructor for the Business Intelligence class.]

    -   [Background: Likely proficient with educational tools and familiar with course content, but not necessarily a data scientist. Needs quick, actionable insights on student performance and engagement.]
-   Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?
    -   [Goal: Gain insights into overall class behavior to adjust instruction, identify struggling students, and provide feedback at scale.]

    -   [Key Questions to Answer:

        -   Which students are consistently missing class?
        -   Are there patterns in performance or engagement over time?
        -   Which skills are students struggling with at the start?
        -   Are certain sessions or topics producing negative sentiments?]
-   What? What data to show and what is its structure?
    -   [Data to Show:
        -   My Class Size: total number of students
        -   My Class Score: overall performance
        -   My Class Attendance: overall engagement
        -   Performance Trends: Class quiz scores, standard deviation, high/low.
        -   Aggregate Attendance/Accuracy: Average attendance/accuracy per group (UGRAD/GRAD).
        -   Attendance Trends: Number of students who attended each session
        -   Sentiment Overview: Average temperature scores by session.]
    -   [Structure: Aggregated and comparative data across all students.]
-   How? How will visualizations support the goal?
    -   Boxplots for quiz score distributions per quiz.
    -   Bar charts comparing UGRAD vs GRAD or year-to-year performance.
    -   Line graph for session-by-session attendance trends.
    -   Sentiment trend line using average temperature scores per session.

**Question 2:** Based on your plan above, make a sketch of what the dashboard would look like. See this week's readings for examples. Be detailed about what kinds of data points and visualizations you want to see in different parts of the page. Consider the user experience and how you should position more general information compared to more specific information, and where you may need some additional explanation to help the viewer understand a graphic, for example. In your sketch, it is useful to give labels to different objects, because in the steps below you can split up work between team members and the labels will help you connect the UI with the data objects. Show your sketches in section to get feedback from the teaching team.

Each dashboard should contain at least 4 data visualizations. You may include any additional summary statistics (e.g. key percentages or tables). ![](images/IMG_5076.png) ![teacher-dashboard](ui-design2.PNG) \# Part 2: Dashboard Wire-frame Implementation

This is where you generate the dashboard layout. You are given a very basic wire frame example for the dashboard below. For more information on how R Shiny Dashboards work, look at <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html> and <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html>. You can add different types of content into a `fuidRow()`. In the starter code, there are 2 rows of content: the first has two little info boxes; the second has two larger viz boxes. You can add more rows and change what is in them as you wish. Follow the naming convention, e.g. `inst.info1` is the first info box for instructors.

Your team can split up the tasks. Some work on creating the UI (this part), while others work on pre-processing the data and creating the statistics and visualizations that will populate the UI (next part).

**Question 3:** Create the layout for the dashboard tabs. You can have as many "tabs" as you like. Each tab is the content displayed when the user clicks on one of the menu items (so it is the page content). Here you are just specifying the wire frame i.e. **what goes where on the pages**, not what goes into it.

# Part 3: Data Pre-processing

Get the data ready for use in the dashboard. Before the next stage, you want to have the data ready in the right format for simple computations and plotting. To do this effectively, you need to know by now what you want to display in each dashboard. However, this is also an iterative process. Once you have completed a first iteration of the design, you can come back to this step and add further pre-processing for more visualizations you like to add. This step is also an opportunity to better understand the structure of the datasets.

The instructor dashboard should show information for all students. The student dashboard is typically focused on an individual student. You can either pick a student (at random or intentionally) and use them as the "reference student" for the student dashboard. Or, a bit more ambitious but also more rewarding to try out, you can create an interactive dashboard in which you select the student and then the dashboard updates to show the information for that student. I would recommend you start with the simpler version and get that to work before you try to make it dynamic.

Use the space below to be ready for your information visualizations in the dashboards.

# Part 4: Prepare All Data Visualizations

This is where you create the content for the wire frames you created above. Again, you can refer to the examples and documentation in <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html> and <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html> for guidance. You can also find many examples online just by searching with Google.

**Question 4:** For each of the pieces of content you planned for in the wire frames above, generate the relevant content. You need to assign them all to the `output` variable by referencing the name of the wire frame element you chose above like this `output$name.of.element`.

# Part 5: Produce Dashboard and Reflect

You should be able to simply run the code below **as is** to see your dashboard.

**Note:** Unfortunately, you cannot knit this part into a pdf. So I added `eval=FALSE` to let the knitting run smoothly and you can submit your PDF.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#######################################
### This code creates the dashboard ###
#######################################

# Here we set up the Header of the dashboard
dhead = dashboardHeader(title = "Clicker Dashboard")

# Here set up the sidebar which has links to two pages
dside = dashboardSidebar(
  sidebarMenu(
    menuItem("Instructor View", tabName = "instructor", icon = icon("dashboard")),
    menuItem("Student View", tabName = "student", icon = icon("th"))
  )
)

# Here we set up the body of the dashboard
dbody = dashboardBody(
    tabItems(
      student_dash,
      instructor_dash
    )
)

# Combining header, sidebar, and body
ui = dashboardPage(dhead, dside, dbody)

# Generating a local instance of your dashboard
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

**Question 5:** Add screenshots of your group's dahsboards below using this syntax or simply add them to the Word document after knitting:

![Dashboard Screenshot](example_dash.png)

**Question 6:** Evaluate your group dashboard from the perspective of the instructor (teacher dashboard) and from the perspective of the student (student dashboard). What do you like about it, what would you change or add to it if you had more time?

*Reflection for the student dashboard*

-   What do you like about it?
    -   We like that the student dashboard provides immediate feedback on performance, sentiment, and engagement. It is visually simple, easy to navigate, and highlights key metrics like quiz scores, clicker performances, and attendance per month. It makes it easier for students to self-monitor their progress without feeling overwhelmed.
-   What would you change or add to it if you had more time?
    -   We would add personalized goal-setting features where students could set learning goals and track their progress over time. I would also incorporate a dynamic, interactive version of the student dashboard for it to update with the select student’s information, but we wanted to prioritize the visualization given the complexity.
-   What was the biggest challenge you faced? How did you address it?
    -   The biggest challenge was understanding how to create relevant variables from the dataset to convey this information. To address this, we took some time understanding each variable to then decide on what/how to use them, along with the help of HiTA to explain this more in depth.

*Reflection for the teacher dashboard*

-   What do you like about it?
    -   We like that the teacher dashboard aggregates student data efficiently, while also providing unique insights (based on program, session, quiz, etc.) We also feel like the visualizations are very clear, simple so it would be easy for an instructor to go through the dashboard and gain information.
-   What would you change or add to it if you had more time?
    -   If we had more time, we would categorize the dashboard based on teaching year. Currently, we combined all 3 years, but if we a dropdown menu where we can view based on year, we feel like it can provide unique insights based on how the instructor structured the course each year.
-   What was the biggest challenges you faced? How did you address it?
    -   The biggest challenge was deciding how much detail to show without making the dashboard too complex or overwhelming for teachers. Through careful planning and providing constructive feedback with the group members we were able to come up with a visually effective dashboard.

# Self-reflection

**Briefly summarize your experience on this homework. What was easy, what was hard, what did you learn?**

-   Generating visualizations was fairly an easy task since it was repetitive. However, understanding which variables/dataset to use was confusing at times. We were able to learn how data can be utilized to generate meaningful dashboards.
-   What I found more challenging was designing a dashboard that would be truly useful for both instructors and students. It took time to consider what metrics mattered most, how to structure the layout, and how to balance visual clarity with depth of insight. Debugging reactive expressions in Shiny also presented some complexity, especially when trying to make filters and plots respond to user input correctly. Through this project, I learned how to integrate multiple datasets into a coherent dashboard, how to use shinydashboard to build a user interface, and how to critically evaluate what makes a visualization useful in an educational context. I also deepened my understanding of student engagement metrics and the kinds of feedback that can support learning at scale.

# Estimate time spent

**We want to give students an estimate of how much time this homework will take. Please indicate how many hours you spent to complete this homework here.**

-   I spent 18 hours.

# Generative AI usage

**As stated in the course syllabus, using generative AI is allowed to help you as you complete this homework. We are interested in how it is being used and whether it is helpful for you.**

-   How much did you use generative AI (e.g., not at all, some, most, or all the questions) and which one did you use?
    -   We only used it for pre-processing and creating visualizations.
-   If you used generative AI, how did you use it and was it helpful?
    -   We used HiTA and Chatgpt to solve various syntax issues with R and generating visualizations.

# Submit Homework

This is the end of the homework. Please **Knit to Word** (if you run into an issue, you can knit to PDF). The resulting file has to show both the R code and R output. Upload it on Canvas before the due date.
